# cryptocurrencies

#Overview

The goal of this project is to create an analysis for our clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. Our client is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for their customers. Our task is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. 

The data we are working with is not ideal, so we will need to process the data to fit the machine learning models. We are going to use unsupervised machine learning. Grouping using a clustering algorithm.
